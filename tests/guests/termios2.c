/* The termios2 ioctls -- TCGETS2 0x802c542a, TCSETS2 0x402c542b, TCSETSW2
 * 0x402c542c, TCSETSF2 0x402c542d (src/monitor/tty.c), self-checking.
 *
 * They carry a 44-byte struct termios2: the 36-byte termios plus c_ispeed and
 * c_ospeed, the way a terminal is given a rate no Bnnn constant names. A glibc
 * since 2.42 builds tcgetattr -- and so isatty -- on them, which is how its
 * guest learns it has a terminal at all. Android's SELinux policy whitelists
 * the ioctls an app may issue on its pty and these are not on the list: the
 * host answers EACCES, on a terminal and on a pipe alike, so such a guest took
 * its terminal for none (bash printed no prompt). The monitor serves them from
 * TCGETS/TCSETS when the host will not, and the answers must be a kernel's
 * whichever way they were reached: this runs over the host as it is and over
 * CNG_TERMIOS2_DENY=1, which refuses them before the host is asked.
 *
 * What is asked, over a real pty: the whole struct comes back and not a byte
 * past it (a canary after it), the first 36 bytes of it are what TCGETS
 * reports, each of the three setters carries all 44 bytes in (c_ospeed
 * included, a different rate each: a copy that stopped at 36 would leave it 0)
 * and the next TCGETS2 returns the rate and the VMIN/VTIME it was given, an
 * unmapped buffer is EFAULT both ways, and a descriptor that is no tty is
 * ENOTTY.
 *
 * The master's termios is the slave's, so a rate set through one end is read
 * back through the other and through the same end (a BOTHER rate that a host
 * cannot hold is kept per terminal by the monitor, which has to know the two
 * ends for one).
 *
 * The rates are arbitrary numbers (BOTHER) where the host's classic termios
 * can hold the marker in c_cflag, which a kernel does and qemu-user does not:
 * its translation table has no entry for it and answers B0. There the rows
 * are made with the Bnnn constants instead, and print the same.
 *
 * The expected output is what this program prints built for a native host and
 * run on a real kernel. A host that cannot give it a pty steps aside with a
 * lone SKIP line.
