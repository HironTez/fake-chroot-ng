/* A detached thread that frees its own stack on the way out.
 *
 * A thread cannot munmap the stack it is standing on from C, so libc does it in
 * four instructions of assembly that touch no stack at all — unmap, then exit:
 *
 *     musl   __unmapself:               mov x8,#215; svc 0; mov x8,#93; svc 0
 *     bionic _exit_with_stack_teardown: mov x8,#215; svc 0; mov x0,#0;
 *                                       mov x8,#93; svc 0
 *
 * Every detached thread of a musl or bionic program ends this way (the JVM's
 * all are, being created detached). The -R rewriter replaces each `svc` with a
 * branch to a trampoline, which builds its frame on the caller's stack and reads
 * every register back from it: after the munmap that stack is gone, and the
 * thread died of a SEGV on the way out — which takes the whole process with it.
 *
 * The sequence is written out here as it stands in libc, and run on a stack the
 * guest mapped for the purpose, so what is asked is the thread's exit and not
 * any libc's idea of one — which is also why the thread is made with a bare
 * clone(2), not pthread_create: a glibc that is handed a thread's stack keeps
 * the descriptor on it in a list, and its next pthread_create would write into
 * what the teardown has freed. Each round starts a thread on a fresh stack,
 * which frees it and exits; the program counts the rounds it survived and
 * prints `survived=N`. Anything short of N means the process died with its
 * thread.
 *
 * Argument: the variant, `musl` (the default) or `bionic`.
