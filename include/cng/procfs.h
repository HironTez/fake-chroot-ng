/* Synthesized /proc files.
 *
 * Host /proc passes through (see cng_fs_translate), but a few files there
 * describe chroot-ng rather than the guest, because we never issue a real
 * execve: cmdline is our invocation, environ our exec-time environment, auxv
 * our exec-time auxv block, and maps names host paths for the guest's own
 * libraries. mounts/mountinfo/mountstats describe the host (on Android, the
 * app-sandbox) mount namespace, which confuses df- and apt-style tools.
 * loadavg, uptime and stat are readable here but denied to apps by Android's
 * SELinux policy, where an unpatched guest tool would simply fail; so are
 * /proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid and overflowgid (bubblewrap reads them first
 * and dies without). Like stat they are served only where the host file is
 * unreadable. And under
 * --fake-id the Uid:/Gid:/Groups: lines of status carry the real invoking id,
 * which ps/top read to name the user.
 *
 * An open of one of those names is diverted to an anonymous in-memory file
 * holding the guest view, handed over as a read-only description with the
 * guest's status flags on it (what the real file gives) and judged by the same
 * open-flag rules the kernel applies to the real file: write intent is
 * EACCES, O_DIRECT EINVAL, O_NOATIME the owner's, and O_PATH, O_DIRECTORY,
 * O_TMPFILE and O_CREAT|O_EXCL are left to the real open, whose answer needs
 * no content. The fd's own account of itself is the real file's too: fstat
 * (and the by-fd forms of newfstatat and statx), fstatfs, the /proc/self/fd
 * link's text and a stat through that link all name and describe the /proc
 * file, not the memfd behind it — found again from the memfd's name, which
 * follows the inode through dup, fork, exec and a reopen. What still shows the
 * memfd through: mmap of the fd succeeds read-only where the real file
 * answers ENODEV, and fsync returns 0 where it is EINVAL; trapping mmap and
 * fsync wholesale for those is not worth what they would cost. Everything
 * else under /proc stays host passthrough, including stat() of these paths
 * (readers open and read them).
 *
 * Ported from arm64chroot's sys_procfs.c. What differs is what does NOT need
 * synthesizing here: the guest is a real host process, so its status, stat,
 * statm and the /proc/<pid>/maps *addresses* are already true, and /proc/version
 * is correct because chroot-ng does not fake uname.
